Scripts for everybody.codes.

No package or nice scripts are created. Days are in directories, might be a mess.

## Quest Data

Data for the Quests is in a private repo, imporated as a git submodule. This is to hide the data from other people competing.

```
data/quest-01/part01.txt 
data/quest-01/part02.txt 
data/quest-01/part03.txt
data/quest-02/part01.txt
```
